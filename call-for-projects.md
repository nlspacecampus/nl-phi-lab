## Overview

The purpose of this Call for Projects at NL PhiLab is to inform you about the opportunity to apply with research projects to be supported by NL PhiLab and to provide you with materials and guidance needed to apply. The Call is permanently open, but evaluation of applications is scheduled periodically. Dates will be posted on our NL PhiLab website.

## Research Themes

We invite you to submit research project ideas in the areas of Earth Observation, Position, Navigation and Timing, and Laser Satellite Communication. Your project should be relevant for one of these themes. In addition to these, we will support any demonstrably good project on other space-related areas.

Proposed activities should have a commercial market potential. To support their ideas, the applicant can identify knowledgeable entities among our partners (see NL PhiLab website).

## Eligibility and Suitability

The project proposal must be submitted by (a team part of) a legal entity or a consortium of legal entities.

The idea must have a valid space connection. For NL PhiLab, the focus will be on the exploitation of space technology, use of knowledge from the space domain, or utilisation of space systems and space-based services in non-space domains (spin-off).

The proposed idea should be based on solid research-driven evidence, should be disruptive, and should have high potential for socio-economic impact. Your team should be able to show evidence that the project will deliver a technological game-changer or address a pressing need that would facilitate the future market adoption.

We will also consider strong proposals for products or services for the space sector, addressing any part of the space value chain (from components to entirely new space systems or related facilities and services) and any related activity (from concept definition to operation), possibly using non-space technology (spin-in).
