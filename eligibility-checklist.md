## Eligibility Checklist

This tool is meant to help you understand whether your team and project idea are eligible and a good fit for NL PhiLab.

These first questions are requirements. You must be able to answer "Yes" to all.

1. Is your research team part of a legal entity established in an ESA Member State?
2. Does your project have a clear connection to space technology or utilize space systems/space-based services?
3. Is the proposed project idea innovative, disruptive, and based on solid research-driven evidence?

An affirmative answer to these following questions is very important, but these subjects could be developed later.

1. Can you demonstrate that the research activity will deliver a benefit to NL PhiLab and the Netherlands?
2. Does your project idea have potential commercial market value?
